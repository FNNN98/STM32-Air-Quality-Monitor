# Hardware Used

- <h3 align="left"> WeActStudio STM32F411CEU6 </h3>

  The STM32F411CEU6 BlackPill is a powerful microcontroller featuring a 100MHz clock speed, 512Kb Flash memory, and 128Kb SRAM. 
  
- <h3 align="left"> Adafruit PMSA003I </h3>
  
  The Adafruit PMSA003I Air Quality Breakout is a sensor that monitors air quality. It measures PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.0 concentrations, as well as particulate matter in different size bins.
  It connects via I2C,  It effectively measures particle concentrations within the PM2.5 standard range of 0~500μg/m³, with a maximum range exceeding 1000μg/m³.
  The module offers high resolution (1μg/m³) and low consistency error (±10%) across different particle concentrations.
  It operates on a 5.0V DC power supply, with an active current draw of ≤100 mA and standby current of ≤200 μA.
  
- <h3 align="left"> Fermion: ENS160 </h3>
  
  The Fermion ENS160 Air Quality Sensor, featuring ScioSense's ENS160 sensor chip, is designed for indoor air quality monitoring, detecting multiple IAQ parameters such as TVOC, eCO2, and AQI.
  Its TrueVOC™ technology integrates metal oxide (MOX) technology for improved accuracy, rapid response, and anti-interference capabilities.
  Equipped with on-chip algorithms, it outputs comprehensive environmental data while also feauturing an embedded automatic baseline correction algorithm ensures long-term sensor stability.. The sensor undergoes a 3-minute preheating phase upon power-on.
